# ATM System

A simple ATM system that stores account data in a text file.

## Core Functionality
- **Account Management**: Create and track multiple user accounts
- **Balance Operations**: Deposit and withdraw funds with validation
- **Transaction History**: Record and display all account activities
- **Data Persistence**: Store all data in a JSON text file (accounts.txt)
- **Withdrawal Limits**: Minimum withdrawal amount of Rs 500

## Implementation
The system uses a Python-based implementation with three main components:
- Core ATM logic (atm.py)
- Command-line interface (main.py)
- Validation tests (test_atm.py)
